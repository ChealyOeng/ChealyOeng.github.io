      <description>Final Product “Great things happen when it’s least expected”.

      <description>Triumph (Screen-print &amp;amp; Paint on Fabric) Conquering hardships is the journey of growth. This piece was created during the time when I was about to leave high school, home, and &amp;rsquo;expand my wings&amp;rsquo; to explore the next chapter in life.
Made with a combination of screen-printing and painting on fabric in large scale bold colour, with the intention of depicting a grand look.</description>

      <description>With a passion for design and love for all things creative, I thrive in environments where innovation and style intersects. From coming with new concepts to collaborating on projects, I find joy in pushing the boundaries of conventional fashion and exploring new realms of artistic expression.
Alongside my passion for design, I bring to the table exceptional organizational and management skills. My ability to maintain clarity amidst complexity allows me to execute projects with efficiency and precision, ensuring that every endeavour I undertake is a testament to both creativity and meticulous planning.</description>
